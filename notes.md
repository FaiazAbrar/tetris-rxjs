Mention game restarts after 3 seconds of game over and game updates high score at the end of each round

Instead of passing full state, only pass necessary values

see optional parameterss

define cube and define what is block

say for each row, get 100 pts. If two rows gone tgt, then 200 pts

ensure blocks drop down after rows are filled

do highscore as soon as it is reached instead of next turn

handloing cube sin reverse:

const dropBlocksAboveClearedRows = (
oldBlocks: BlockPosition[],
clearedRows: number[]
): BlockPosition[] =>
oldBlocks
.sort((a, b) => {
const maxA = Math.max(...a.map((cube) => cube.y));
const maxB = Math.max(...b.map((cube) => cube.y));
return maxB - maxA;
})
.map((block) =>
block.map((cube) => {
const rowsClearedBelow = clearedRows.filter(
(row) => row > cube.y
).length;
return rowsClearedBelow > 0
? { x: cube.x, y: cube.y + rowsClearedBelow }
: cube;
})
);

handling cubes top to bottom:

const dropBlocksAboveClearedRows = (
oldBlocks: BlockPosition[],
clearedRows: number[]
): BlockPosition[] =>
oldBlocks.map((block) =>
block.map((cube) => {
const rowsClearedBelow = clearedRows.filter((row) => row > cube.y).length;
return rowsClearedBelow > 0
? { x: cube.x, y: cube.y + rowsClearedBelow }
: cube;
})
);

mention how u may use currying to genrate shapes for previw and nrmal as possible improvement

mention how objct collided, move and rotate can be used in any place other porjects anything in 2d array

most fucntions dotn maek any assumptions about the game they are used in
